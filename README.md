Welcome to the Fluid-Particle Cursor project! This is a fun and entertaining web application that replaces the standard mouse cursor with a mesmerizing fluid-particle cursor. The cursor is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and aims to add a playful touch to your website or web application.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://codepen.io/abdul-1432/pen/eYQjjaj) to experience the fluid-particle cursor in action.

## How It Works

The Fluid-Particle Cursor is created using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The basic structure of the web application is defined using HTML. A canvas element is used to render the particle cursor.

- **CSS**: The visual styling and layout of the web application are handled using CSS. The cursor is customized to give it a fluid and dynamic appearance.

- **JavaScript**: The core functionality of the Fluid-Particle Cursor is implemented using JavaScript. It involves creating and animating particles based on the user's mouse movement.

## Installation

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd fluid-particle-cursor
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Use

Once you have the web application running in your browser, you'll notice that the default cursor has been replaced by a fluid-particle cursor.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Fluid-Particle Cursor to fit your preferences or the style of your website. You can modify the following aspects:

- **Particle Appearance**: Adjust the size, color, and shape of the particles in the CSS file.
